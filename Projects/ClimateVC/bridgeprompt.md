‚ö°Ô∏è Enhanced PromptBridge Blueprint

üß† Section 1: Application Foundation
üìå Core Problem & Vision
Problem:Tracking investment trends in climate tech startups is costly, slow, and requires expensive proprietary tools like PitchBook or CB Insights. This creates a barrier for smaller investors, nonprofits, and policymakers who need timely, accurate data to identify emerging innovators, funding gaps, and market trends.
Vision:Build an AI-powered, open-source, low-cost funding tracker that scrapes and tags publicly available data to provide near real-time insight into climate tech startup investments. The tool will offer searchable, structured funding event data, letting users track investors, funding stages, amounts, and sub-sectors‚Äîmaking this market intelligence accessible to all.

üéØ Target Audience & Context
	‚Ä¢	Primary Users:
	‚Ä¢	Investors, analysts, climate tech founders, and researchers
	‚Ä¢	Intermediate tech comfort (comfortable with web apps, some data filtering)
	‚Ä¢	Secondary Users:
	‚Ä¢	Nonprofits and policymakers monitoring climate innovation (low tech comfort)
	‚Ä¢	Usage Context:
	‚Ä¢	Desktop browser (web app) during work/research hours
	‚Ä¢	Data exploration, deal discovery, and reporting

‚úÖ Success Definition for MVP
	‚Ä¢	A functional prototype that collects and tags 25‚Äì50 climate tech funding events from public sources
	‚Ä¢	Search and filter funding events by investor, sector, geography, and stage
	‚Ä¢	Generate clean, normalized data (startup, investors, amount, date, round, location, sub-sector)
	‚Ä¢	Provide downloadable CSV export of filtered results
	‚Ä¢	(Bonus) Basic dashboard visualizing top investors, sectors, and geographic trends

üì± Platform Priority
	‚Ä¢	 Web App (Browser-based)
	‚Ä¢	 Mobile App (iOS/Android/Both)
	‚Ä¢	 Desktop App (Windows/macOS/Linux)
	‚Ä¢	 API-First Service
	‚Ä¢	 Multi-platform (specify priority order)

üë£ User Journey Mapping (Using Krug‚Äôs Principles)
	‚Ä¢	Entry Point: User opens the web app via browser URL or bookmarked page.
	‚Ä¢	Onboarding: First-time users see a brief intro text about the app‚Äôs purpose and usage tips (simple and clear, no login required).
	‚Ä¢	Core Workflow:
	‚Ä¢	User applies filters (sector, geography, investor, stage).
	‚Ä¢	System returns a list of funding event cards.
	‚Ä¢	User clicks a card to view detailed info or navigates to startup/investor mini-profile.
	‚Ä¢	Optionally exports data.
	‚Ä¢	Edge Cases:
	‚Ä¢	No data found for filters ‚Üí show helpful ‚ÄúNo results found‚Äù message with tips to broaden search.
	‚Ä¢	Scraping or API failure ‚Üí display status alert with retry option.
	‚Ä¢	Exit/Completion: User downloads CSV or closes app after reviewing data.

‚öôÔ∏è System Logic & Data Flow
	‚Ä¢	Triggers:
	‚Ä¢	User applies or changes filters ‚Üí app queries local dataset for matching funding events.
	‚Ä¢	Periodic scraping jobs ‚Üí update dataset with new funding events.
	‚Ä¢	Business Rules:
	‚Ä¢	Only include events tagged as climate tech relevant.
	‚Ä¢	Normalize investor names and funding stages for consistency.
	‚Ä¢	Filter out duplicate or irrelevant data.
	‚Ä¢	Data Transformations:
	‚Ä¢	Raw scraped text ‚Üí NLP entity extraction (startup, investors, amounts, dates, rounds, location, sub-sector) ‚Üí normalized structured records ‚Üí saved to CSV/DB.
	‚Ä¢	Integration Points:
	‚Ä¢	Scraper modules ‚Üí NLP tagging ‚Üí storage (CSV/SQLite) ‚Üí Streamlit frontend.

üß≠ UX Uncertainty Areas
	‚Ä¢	 Navigation structure: Flat vs sidebar filtering?
	‚Ä¢	 Information hierarchy: How much detail in mini-cards?
	‚Ä¢	 Error handling patterns: Graceful failures in scraping or AI tagging?
	‚Ä¢	 Accessibility considerations: Keyboard navigation, screen reader support?
	‚Ä¢	 Cognitive load optimization: Filter complexity vs usability?

üë£ User Flow & Core Logic in Gherkin

Feature: Climate Tech Funding Tracker User Flow

  Scenario: User searches for funding events by filters
    Given the user is on the Home/Search Page
    When the user selects a sector filter "Carbon Capture"
    And the user selects a geography filter "Europe"
    And the user selects a funding stage filter "Series A"
    And the user clicks "Search"
    Then the app displays a list of funding event cards matching the filters

  Scenario: User views details of a funding event
    Given the user sees a list of funding event cards
    When the user clicks on a funding event card for "Startup X"
    Then the app displays the funding event details including:
      | Startup Name  | Startup X                   |
      | Investors    | Investor A, Investor B      |
      | Amount       | $10 million                 |
      | Funding Stage| Series A                   |
      | Date         | 2025-07-18                  |
      | Location     | Europe                      |
      | Sub-sector   | Carbon Capture              |

  Scenario: User views investor or startup profile
    Given the user is viewing a funding event card
    When the user clicks on the investor name "Investor A"
    Then the app displays a profile page for "Investor A" including:
      | Recent Deals | List of recent funding events invested in          |
      | Focus Areas  | Climate tech sectors investor is interested in     |
      | Regions      | Geography of investments                             |

    When the user clicks on the startup name "Startup X"
    Then the app displays a profile page for "Startup X" including:
      | Past Funding Rounds | List of previous funding events                    |
      | Investors           | List of investors                                 |
      | Sector              | Climate tech sub-sector                            |

  Scenario: User exports filtered results
    Given the user has applied filters and is viewing funding event cards
    When the user clicks the "Export CSV" button
    Then the app downloads a CSV file with the filtered funding events

  Scenario: User views insights dashboard (Bonus)
    Given the user navigates to the Insights Dashboard
    Then the app displays charts showing:
      | Metric               | Description                              |
      | Most Active Investors| Investors with the most deals in the period |
      | Funding by Sector    | Amount raised by climate tech subsectors |
      | Geographic Gaps      | Underfunded regions or categories         |
