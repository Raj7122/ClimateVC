üè† LeaseGuard Enhanced PromptBridge Blueprint
Redis-Powered AI Assistant for Tenant Rights & Lease Enforcement
Final Implementation-Ready Version | Cursor Agent Compatible

‚ö°Ô∏è Section 1: Application Foundation
üìå Core Problem & Vision
Problem: Renters often sign leases without fully understanding their rights or the enforceability of clauses. When disputes arise (e.g. eviction threats, repair neglect, illegal rent hikes), they are overwhelmed, under-informed, and unsupported in real time.
Vision: Build LeaseGuard ‚Äî a real-time, AI-powered assistant that reads lease documents, flags illegal or unenforceable clauses, and gives tenants tailored advice based on local housing law. Powered by Redis 8 for lightning-fast vector search, document chunking, semantic caching, and event-driven alerts, LeaseGuard is a legal exosuit for renters.
üéØ Target Audience & Context
Primary Users: NYC tenants and voucher holders (Beginner‚ÄìIntermediate tech literacy).
Secondary Users: Tenant advocacy orgs, legal aid workers (Intermediate‚ÄìAdvanced).
Usage Context: Mobile-first for on-the-go assistance during disputes; desktop for deep lease analysis and document uploads.
‚úÖ Success Definition for MVP
Users upload a lease (PDF or image-to-text).
System extracts clauses, runs local housing law checks, and flags violations.
User can ask follow-up questions in natural language.
MVP supports English and Spanish leases.
Logs session ID to track multi-query journeys.
Redis 8 powers all real-time logic, search, and caching.

Feature: Lease Document Upload and Analysis
  As a NYC tenant
  I want to upload my lease document and get instant analysis
  So that I can understand my rights and identify potentially illegal clauses

  Background:
    Given the LeaseGuard application is running
    And Redis Cloud is connected and operational
    And the housing law database is populated with NYC regulations
    And Gemini Flash 1.5 LLM is available

  @core @mobile-first
  Scenario: Successful lease upload and clause extraction
    Given I am on the LeaseGuard home page
    When I click the "Upload Your Lease" button
    And I select a PDF file from my device
    And the file is under 10MB in size
    Then I should see a progress bar indicating "Analyzing your lease..."
    And the system should extract text using PDF.js
    And the document should be chunked into clauses
    And I should see "Analysis Complete" within 5 seconds
    And I should be redirected to the lease analysis dashboard

  @core @accessibility
  Scenario: Upload with scanned lease document (OCR required)
    Given I am on the upload page
    When I select an image file (JPG/PNG) of my lease
    And the image contains scanned text
    Then I should see "Processing scanned document..." message
    And Tesseract.js should begin OCR extraction
    And I should see estimated processing time
    When OCR processing completes
    Then I should see the extracted text for review
    And I should be able to confirm or edit the extracted content
    And I should proceed to clause analysis

  @core @error-handling
  Scenario: Upload fails due to unreadable document
    Given I am on the upload page
    When I select a corrupted or heavily distorted image
    And OCR processing cannot extract readable text
    Then I should see "Unable to read document" error message
    And I should see "Try uploading a clearer image" suggestion
    And I should see a "Manual Text Entry" fallback option
    And I should be able to type my lease clauses manually

  @core @multilingual
  Scenario: Spanish language lease processing
    Given I have set my language preference to Spanish
    When I upload a lease document in Spanish
    Then the system should detect the Spanish language
    And clause extraction should process Spanish legal terms
    And housing law comparisons should use Spanish regulation database
    And all UI messages should display in Spanish
    And flagged violations should show Spanish legal explanations

Feature: Clause Analysis and Violation Detection
  As a tenant
  I want to see which clauses in my lease might be illegal
  So that I can take appropriate action to protect my rights

  @core @redis-vector-search
  Scenario: Illegal clause detection with high confidence
    Given my lease has been uploaded and processed
    And clauses have been stored in Redis with vector embeddings
    When the system performs similarity matching against housing law database
    And a clause about "security deposit of 3 months rent" is found
    Then the clause should be flagged as "CRITICAL" violation
    And I should see the clause highlighted in red
    And I should see the explanation "NYC limits security deposits to 1 month's rent maximum"
    And I should see the legal reference "NYC Housing Maintenance Code ¬ß27-2056"
    And I should see a "Contact Legal Aid" button

  @core @redis-caching
  Scenario: Medium severity clause flagging
    Given my lease contains a clause about "tenant responsible for all repairs"
    When the system checks this against warranty of habitability laws
    Then the clause should be flagged as "HIGH" severity
    And I should see it highlighted in orange
    And I should see "Landlords cannot waive repair responsibilities" explanation
    And the result should be cached in Redis for similar future queries

  @nice-to-have @trending
  Scenario: Clause with no violations found
    Given my lease contains standard rent payment terms
    When the system analyzes the clause for violations
    And no similar patterns exist in the illegal clause database
    Then the clause should be marked as "COMPLIANT"
    And I should see it with a green checkmark
    And I should see "This clause appears standard and legal"

Feature: AI-Powered Q&A with Contextual Memory
  As a tenant
  I want to ask follow-up questions about my lease
  So that I can get personalized advice based on my specific situation

  @core @conversational-ai
  Scenario: First question about flagged clause
    Given I have a lease with flagged violations
    And I am viewing the analysis dashboard
    When I type "What should I do about the security deposit issue?"
    Then Gemini Flash 1.5 should process my question
    And the system should retrieve relevant clause context from Redis
    And I should receive a response within 2.5 seconds
    And the response should reference my specific security deposit clause
    And I should see actionable next steps like "Contact your landlord" or "File a complaint"

  @core @session-memory
  Scenario: Follow-up question with context retention
    Given I previously asked about security deposit violations
    And my session context is stored in Redis
    When I ask "How do I get my extra deposit money back?"
    Then the system should remember our previous conversation
    And the response should build on the security deposit context
    And I should not need to re-explain my situation
    And the conversation history should be maintained in my session

  @core @legal-disclaimer
  Scenario: Complex legal question requiring professional help
    Given I ask "Should I break my lease and stop paying rent?"
    When Gemini processes this high-stakes legal question
    Then the response should include appropriate legal disclaimers
    And I should see "This is not legal advice" warning
    And I should be offered connection to legal aid services
    And the system should not provide definitive legal recommendations

Feature: Session Management and Timeline View
  As a tenant
  I want to review my previous questions and lease analysis
  So that I can track my progress and share information with advocates

  @nice-to-have @session-tracking
  Scenario: Viewing conversation timeline
    Given I have had multiple conversations about my lease
    And my session data is stored in Redis and Supabase
    When I click "View My Timeline"
    Then I should see a chronological list of my questions and answers
    And I should see the dates and times of each interaction
    And I should be able to expand each conversation thread
    And I should see which clauses were discussed in each conversation

  @nice-to-have @sharing
  Scenario: Sharing session with legal aid
    Given I have completed my lease analysis
    And I have flagged violations that need professional help
    When I click "Share with Legal Aid"
    Then I should see a unique shareable link generated
    And the link should provide access to my lease analysis
    And the link should include my conversation history
    And the legal aid worker should be able to view flagged clauses
    And personal identifying information should be redacted from the shared view

Supabase for structured analytics logging (optional).
Feature: Document Processing Pipeline
  As the LeaseGuard system
  I need to efficiently process uploaded documents
  So that users receive fast and accurate lease analysis

  Background:
    Given Redis Cloud is configured with vector search capabilities
    And the system has access to Gemini Flash 1.5 API
    And PDF.js and Tesseract.js libraries are loaded

  @system @redis-streams
  Scenario: Document upload triggers processing pipeline
    Given a user uploads a PDF lease document
    When the file upload completes successfully
    Then a "document_uploaded" event should be published to Redis Stream "lease_processing"
    And the event should contain user_session_id, document_id, and file_metadata
    And a background worker should consume the event within 100ms
    And the document should be queued for text extraction

  @system @ocr-processing
  Scenario: PDF text extraction and chunking
    Given a PDF document is queued for processing
    When the text extraction worker processes the document
    Then PDF.js should extract text content
    And the text should be split into logical clauses based on line breaks and legal formatting
    And each clause should be assigned a unique clause_id
    And clauses should be stored as separate entries with metadata
    And a "clauses_extracted" event should be published to Redis Stream

  @system @vector-embeddings
  Scenario: Clause vectorization and storage
    Given clauses have been extracted from a lease document
    When the vectorization worker processes the clauses
    Then each clause should be sent to Gemini Flash 1.5 for embedding generation
    And the 768-dimensional vectors should be stored in Redis vector index
    And clause metadata should be stored in RedisJSON format
    And the vector index should support cosine similarity search
    And a "vectorization_complete" event should be published

  @system @performance
  Scenario: Concurrent document processing
    Given multiple users upload documents simultaneously
    When the system processes 10 concurrent uploads
    Then each document should be processed independently
    And Redis Streams should handle event ordering correctly
    And no processing conflicts should occur
    And total processing time should remain under 5 seconds per document
    And system resources should not exceed 80% utilization

Feature: Housing Law Violation Detection
  As the LeaseGuard system
  I need to accurately identify illegal lease clauses
  So that tenants receive reliable legal guidance

  @system @redis-vector-search
  Scenario: Similarity matching against violation patterns
    Given a lease clause "Security deposit shall be 2.5 months rent"
    And the housing law database contains violation patterns in Redis
    When the system performs vector similarity search
    Then the clause vector should be compared against violation pattern vectors
    And similarity scores should be calculated using cosine distance
    And patterns with similarity >= 0.85 should be considered matches
    And the highest matching violation should be selected

  @system @classification-logic
  Scenario: Violation severity classification
    Given a clause matches a known violation pattern
    When the system determines violation severity
    Then security deposit violations should be classified as "CRITICAL"
    And repair responsibility waivers should be classified as "HIGH"
    And minor disclosure issues should be classified as "MEDIUM"
    And unclear language should be classified as "LOW"
    And the classification should be stored with the clause metadata

  @system @caching-strategy
  Scenario: Caching violation detection results
    Given a clause has been analyzed for violations
    When the analysis completes
    Then the violation result should be cached in Redis with TTL of 24 hours
    And the cache key should include clause text hash and law database version
    And future identical clauses should return cached results within 50ms
    And cache hit rate should exceed 70% for common clause patterns

Feature: Contextual AI Question Processing
  As the LeaseGuard system
  I need to provide contextually relevant answers to user questions
  So that tenants receive personalized and accurate guidance

  @system @context-retrieval
  Scenario: Question context preparation
    Given a user asks "What can I do about the security deposit?"
    And the user's lease contains flagged security deposit violations
    When the system prepares the LLM context
    Then relevant lease clauses should be retrieved from Redis vector search
    And flagged violations should be included in context
    And previous conversation history should be retrieved from session storage
    And NYC housing law references should be added to context
    And the complete context should be under 4000 tokens

  @system @llm-integration
  Scenario: Gemini Flash 1.5 query processing
    Given a user question with prepared context
    When the system sends the query to Gemini Flash 1.5
    Then the request should include the user question
    And the request should include relevant lease clause context
    And the request should include applicable housing law information
    And the request should specify response format and length limits
    And the response should be received within 800ms
    And the response should be cached for identical future queries

  @system @response-processing
  Scenario: LLM response validation and formatting
    Given Gemini returns a response to a user question
    When the system processes the response
    Then the response should be checked for harmful or incorrect legal advice
    And legal disclaimers should be automatically appended
    And the response should be formatted for mobile-friendly display
    And relevant clause references should be highlighted
    And the response should be stored in conversation history

Feature: Session State Management
  As the LeaseGuard system
  I need to maintain user session state across interactions
  So that conversations remain contextual and personalized

  @system @session-creation
  Scenario: New user session initialization
    Given a user visits LeaseGuard for the first time
    When they begin the lease upload process
    Then a unique session_id should be generated
    And session metadata should be stored in Redis with 7-day TTL
    And the session should track user preferences (language, notifications)
    And anonymous user sessions should be supported without authentication
    And session state should be synced to Supabase for persistence

  @system @session-persistence
  Scenario: Session data synchronization
    Given a user has an active session with lease analysis
    When they ask questions or interact with the system
    Then each interaction should update the session state in Redis
    And conversation history should be appended to the session
    And session metadata should be synced to Supabase every 5 minutes
    And session expiration should be extended on user activity
    And inactive sessions should be cleaned up after 7 days

  @system @cross-device-continuity
  Scenario: Session recovery across devices
    Given a user starts analysis on mobile and switches to desktop
    When they log in with the same Clerk account
    Then their session state should be retrieved from Supabase
    And their lease analysis should be restored in Redis
    And conversation history should be available
    And flagged clauses should display with original analysis
    And they should be able to continue where they left off

Feature: Error Handling and System Resilience
  As the LeaseGuard system
  I need to handle failures gracefully
  So that users have a reliable experience even when components fail

  @system @redis-failover
  Scenario: Redis connection failure handling
    Given Redis Cloud becomes temporarily unavailable
    When a user tries to ask a question about their lease
    Then the system should detect the Redis connection failure
    And a fallback message should be displayed: "Service temporarily unavailable"
    And the user question should be queued for processing when Redis recovers
    And basic functionality should continue using local storage cache
    And users should be notified when full service is restored

  @system @llm-failure-recovery
  Scenario: Gemini API failure handling
    Given Gemini Flash 1.5 API returns an error or timeout
    When a user submits a question
    Then the system should retry the request up to 3 times
    And if all retries fail, a graceful error message should be shown
    And the user should be offered alternative actions like "Contact Legal Aid"
    And the failed query should be logged for later processing
    And the system should automatically retry when the API recovers

  @system @data-consistency
  Scenario: Partial processing failure recovery
    Given a lease document is partially processed (text extracted but not vectorized)
    When the user tries to ask questions about clauses
    Then the system should detect incomplete processing state
    And processing should automatically resume from the last successful step
    And the user should see a progress indicator for the remaining processing
    And no duplicate processing should occur
    And processing state should be atomically updated in Redis

  @system @monitoring-alerting
  Scenario: System health monitoring
    Given the LeaseGuard system is running in production
    When system metrics are collected every minute
    Then Redis query response times should be monitored
    And Gemini API latency and error rates should be tracked
    And document processing success rates should be measured
    And user session creation/expiration rates should be logged
    And alerts should be triggered if any metric exceeds thresholds
    And system administrators should receive notifications for critical issues

üéØ Critical Implementation Details
Redis Configuration
// redis-config.js
const redis = new Redis({
  host: process.env.REDIS_HOST,
  port: process.env.REDIS_PORT,
  password: process.env.REDIS_PASSWORD,
  // Enable vector search
  modules: ['search', 'json', 'timeseries']
});

// Create vector index for clause similarity
await redis.call('FT.CREATE', 'clause_idx', 
  'ON', 'JSON', 
  'PREFIX', '1', 'clause:', 
  'SCHEMA', 
  '$.text', 'AS', 'text', 'TEXT',
  '$.vector', 'AS', 'vector', 'VECTOR', 'FLAT', '6', 
  'TYPE', 'FLOAT32', 'DIM', '768', 'DISTANCE_METRIC', 'COSINE'
);
Clause Matching Algorithm
// clause-matcher.js
async function findSimilarClauses(inputClause, threshold = 0.85) {
  // Generate embedding for input clause
  const embedding = await generateEmbedding(inputClause);
  
  // Vector search in Redis
  const results = await redis.call('FT.SEARCH', 'clause_idx',
    `*=>[KNN 5 @vector $vector AS score]`,
    'PARAMS', '2', 'vector', Buffer.from(Float32Array.from(embedding).buffer),
    'RETURN', '3', 'text', 'metadata', 'score',
    'SORTBY', 'score'
  );
  
  // Filter by similarity threshold
  return results.filter(result => result.score >= threshold);
}
